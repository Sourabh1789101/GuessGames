# GuessGames
 This code is a number guessing game with three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. Players guess a randomly generated number, and the game tracks the number of attempts. It saves the best scores, can reset scores, and displays current scores. The main menu allows mode selection and game initiation.
